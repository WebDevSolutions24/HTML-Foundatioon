			<h2>What are Web Frameworks</h2>

				<p>Web applications have evolved at a rate that the usability and interactivity they provide rival that of a native application. The technology and the expertise needed to build tailored solutions that reach this level of proficiency is demanding. Thankfully, there are tools that make web application development easier, one of them being a web app framework.</p>

			<h3>What are Web Application Frameworks?</h3>

			<p>
				‘Web Application Frameworks’ or ‘Web Frameworks’ as <em>“a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources and web APIs”</em>. In simple words, <strong>web frameworks are a piece of software that offers a way to create and run web applications.</strong> Thus, you don’t need to code on your own and look for probable miscalculations and faults.
			</p>

			<p>
				In earlier days of web app development, web frameworks were introduced as a means to end hand-coding of applications where just the developer of a particular app could change it. That was long ago, now we have web-specific languages and the trouble with changing an app’s structure is resolved because of the arrival of a general performance. Now, depending upon your task you may choose one web framework that fulfills all your requirements or converges multiple frameworks.
			</p>

			<h3>Types of Web Frameworks</h3>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Server-Side Frameworks</h3>

					<p>
						The rules and architecture of the server-side frameworks permit you to create simple pages, landings and forms of different kinds. To create a web application with a well-developed interface you need a wider range of functionality. Server-side frameworks handle HTTP requests, database control and management, URL mapping, etc. These frameworks can improve security and form the output data- simplifying the development process. Some of the top server-side frameworks are –
					</p>
				</li>

					<ul>
						<li>.NET (C#)</li>
						<li>Django (Python)</li>
						<li>Ruby on Rails (Ruby)</li>
						<li>Express (JavaScript/Node.JS)</li>
						<li>Symfony (PHP)</li>
					</ul>

				<li>
					<h3>Client-Side Frameworks</h3>

					<p>
						Client-side frameworks don’t take care of the business logic like the server-side ones. They function inside the browser. Therefore, you can enhance and implement new user interfaces. A number of animated features can be created with frontend and single page applications. Every client-side framework varies in functionality and use. Here are some client-side frameworks for comparison’s sake; all of whom use JavaScript as their programming language-
					</p>
				</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Angular</li>
						<li>Ember.JS</li>
						<li>Vue.JS</li>
						<li>React.JS</li>
					</ul>

			<h3>Web Application Framework- Architecture</h3>

			<p>
			Most of the web frameworks depend on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The reason why this pattern is preferred lies in its rational design that separates the app logic from the interface and forms the three essential parts that are represented in the architecture’s name — MVC (Model-View-Controller).

			<ol>
				<li><h3>Model</h3></li>

				<p>
					The Model comprises of all the data, business logic layers, its guidelines and functions. The Model, upon getting user input data from the Controller, tells the way an updated interface should be displayed directly to the View.
				</p>

				<li><h3>View</h3></li>

				<p>
					The View is for the graphical representation of the data like graph or charts etc. It is the apps’ front-end. The View gets the user input and communicates the same to the Controller for examination and then update and reconstructs itself according to the Model’s instructions, or the Controller’s in case the modification requirement is minimum.
				</p>

				<li><h3>Controller</h3></li>

				<p>
					The Controller translates the input data into the scope of commands of the previous ones. It is the midway between the Model and the View. It gets the user input from the View; after processing it, the Controller notifies the Model (or View) of the changes required.
				</p>

				<p>
					The talking point about many discussions regarding the Controller is that it isn’t always essential (giving more importance to the separation of logic from the interface). Assigning input processing, however, to either Model or View messes up the MVC’s traditional mantra of ‘Separated Presentation’-where tasks are separated on type-basis. For the project to remain transparent, adaptable and maintainable, each component in the MVC must be responsible for a sole line of tasks.
